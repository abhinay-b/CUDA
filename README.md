# CUDA sample programs

This repository contains the following programs written in CUDA:
1. 1D Stencil: Apply 1D stencil to given 1D array of elements using shared memory. As a result, each output element is the sum of input elements within a radius.
2. Matrix multiplication: Calculate matrix multiplication with and without shared memory.
3. Average filter: Apply average filter on a 2D matrix using CUDA using share memory.
